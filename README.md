# JASDTester
The ASDTester assess the efficiency and correctness of an ASDParser for ASD grammars on an
English Noun Phrase input (no semantics).  It is designed to demonstrate the alternative ways 
an English noun phrase such as "the big black dog", can be parsed.
The output is displayed  in side-tree and bracketed forms. Many different parses of the same noun phrase are possible.  
Upgraded to include a toolbar with icons to be used together with the original text menu.
